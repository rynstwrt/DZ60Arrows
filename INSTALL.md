# How to Flash the Firmware:

1. **Download a version of the firmware.**
    * You only need the .hex file to install, but you can upload the .json file to [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/#/dz60/LAYOUT_60_ansi) to edit the firmware.


2. **Download QMK Toolbox.**
    * You can get it [from here](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases).


3. **Click *Tools > Install Drivers...* in QMK Toolbox.**


4. **Click the Open button** and select the downloaded .hex file.


5. **Put your keyboard into DFU mode.**
    * On a DZ60 this is usually done by pressing and holding the button on the back.


6. **Click the Flash button.**
    * The firmware will begin to flash to your DZ60.
